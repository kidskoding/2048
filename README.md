# 2048

A clone of the iconic number-themed tile sliding puzzle game, 2048, built using Python and Pygame. 

2048 is a popular tile sliding puzzle game, where a player must continuously merge two like smaller tiles in order to form one bigger tile (e.g. merging a tile with a value 2 and another tile with a value 2, forms one bigger tile with double the tiles' values). This process repeats until a tile is formed with the value 2048!

## Playing the game
Use the up/left/down/right keys, or WASD to move the tiles in up, left, down, and right respective order to form the tile 2048! The game ends whenever there are no more empty spaces and adjacent tiles with the same value!

#### If there are no tiles that can merge or no spaces to add new tiles, the game is over!
