# 2048

A clone of the iconic tile sliding puzzle game built using Python and Pygame. 

2048 is a popular tile sliding puzzle game, where a player must continuously merge two like smaller tiles in order to form one bigger tile (e.g. merging a tile with a value 2 and another tile with a value 2, forms one bigger tile with double the tiles' values). This process repeats until a tile is formed with the value 2048!
